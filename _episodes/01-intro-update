# Lesson

## "Messy data"

Data needs to be consistent in a lot of ways so that you can work with it. The most obvious way to create consistency is by 
formatting your data so that columns contain data for one variable of one data type and rows contain data for one observation (see the 
lesson on [Spreadsheets](https://nesclic.github.io/spreadsheets-socsci-update/). But even if you have carefully structured your 
spreadsheet, errors can creep in that will cause you issues during analysis.

Today we are going to talk about some of the common things that make data "messy". These can include:
* Typos and different spellings
* Codes mixed in with full words
* Different people entering things in different ways
* Combining sources that use different codes that need to be reconciled
* Updating codes or names from an older data set

Most data is at least a little messy. You will probably spend a lot of time cleaning data, and it is an iterative process. Everyone who 
works with data has to deal with this; you are not alone!

##OpenRefine



## Motivations for the OpenRefine Lesson

* Data is often very messy. OpenRefine provides a set of tools to allow you to identify and amend the messy data.
* It is important to know what you did to your data. Additionally, journals, granting agencies, and other institutions are requiring documentation of the steps you took when working with your data. With OpenRefine, you can capture all actions applied to your raw data and share them with your publication as supplemental material.
* All actions are easily reversed in OpenRefine.
* If you save your work it will be to a new file. OpenRefine always uses a copy of your data and _does not_ modify your original dataset.
* Data cleaning steps often need repeating with multiple files. OpenRefine keeps track of all of your actions and allows them to be applied to different datasets.
* Some concepts such as clustering algorithms are quite complex, but OpenRefine makes it easy to introduce them, use them, and show their power.

## Features

* Open source ([source on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine)).
* A large growing community, from novice to expert, ready to help. See Getting
  Help section below.
* Works with large-ish datasets (100,000 rows). Can adjust memory allocation to
  accommodate larger datasets.

## Before we get started

Note: this is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud). It runs inside your browser, but no web connection is needed.

Follow the [Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup.html) instructions to install OpenRefine.

If after installation and running OpenRefine, it does not automatically open for you, point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3333/ or http://localhost:3333 to launch the program.
